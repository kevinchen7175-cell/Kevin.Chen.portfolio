## About Me

I am a dedicated **MS Health Informatics student** at Indiana University Indianapolis with a passion for leveraging artificial intelligence and data science to transform healthcare delivery. Currently serving as a Data Scientist Intern at Essentia Health, I work at the intersection of clinical informatics, machine learning, and healthcare innovation.

My journey began in dental school in India, where I realized my potential to impact healthcare extended beyond individual patient care. This realization led me to health informatics, where I could improve systems that benefit thousands of patients simultaneously.
